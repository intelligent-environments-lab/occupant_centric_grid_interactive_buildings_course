    "# Homework 2 - Getting to know the Southern Company Smart Neighborhood dataset\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will familiarize yourself with the [Southern Company Smart Neighborhood](https://www.georgiapower.com/residential/save-money-and-energy/smart-neighborhood.html) dataset from a neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia, USA by combining your SQL skills with your data analysis, visualization skills. The entire dataset consists of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) time series that provides hourly electricity bought from and sold to the grid, submeter time series of plug loads, thermostat data, water heater use data, dynamic electricity pricing time series, battery and solar-inverter time series, e.t.c. \n",
    "\n",
    "This homework makes use of just the AMI data to learn about the electricity consumption patterns in the 46 buildings. There is also AMI data from 44 buildings considered to be baseline buildings that have similar floorplan as the smart neighborhood buildings but not as efficient and without battery and PV. In this homework, you will compare the electricity consumption of buildings within the smart neighborhood and across both the smart and baseline neighborhoods and also discover the typical daily profiles of each building using clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice in the AMI data that for each timestamp and building, there are `kWh R`, `kWh F` or `kWh F + R` values. Sometimes there are only `kWh R` and `kWh F` or `kWh F` alone.  `kWh R`is kWh Reverse. It is tracking reverse power flow out of the home (the solar energy being sold back to utility from each home). It is typically 0 but there are sometimes where it is not.  `kWh F` is kWh Forward and is all the energy purchased from the utility. While you will insert data for all cases into the database, you should only use `kWh F` values in this homework which will be referred to as `net electricity consumption`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will build a regression model that predicts the net electricity consumption of any one building of your choice in either the smart or baseline neighborhood."
