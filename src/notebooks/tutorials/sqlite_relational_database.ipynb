    "# Relational database: SQLite\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the concepts of a relational database which is the a popular approach to storing tabular data that have meaningful relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are most likely more familiar with using flat files e.g. `.csv` files to store and retrieve data. `.csv` files are excellent for storing and retrieving modestly large data and can be easily inspected in a text editor without needing to install or know how to use special software. They are also easily transferable from one user or machine to another without the risk of losing access or corruption. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, flat files start to fail when the data size becomes large and you need to quickly query it to extract information. They also fail when one needs to enforce strict data integrity measures e.g., only allowing specific data type in a column, only allowing specific categories in a column, making sure that numeric values are positive or making sure that no row is duplicated to mention a few of these measures. Also, making edits to a large-sized flat file can be difficult as it requires that you read the entire file into memory, make the edit then write back to disk. Furthermore, if you have a group of flat files that are related in someway, you will need to invent and maintain a method to keep track of those relationships in a way that is understood by you the designer but also anyone else who make use of the dataset. An example of this will be one `.csv` file that holds metadata for a group of buildings and another that holds electricity consumption time series for the buildings. You may choose to define a `building_id` column in both files that helps link the two however, a change in the column name in either file or changing the id in any row of either file will break this relationship without any repercussions. These issues with flat files escalate when you work in large teams and have many people accessing the same flat file at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are workarounds to solve some of the flat file issues while still providing some of its features. For example, Excel lets you define types for columns however, there is a limit to the number of rows a single Excel sheet can hold and this design feature can have very [serious consequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NuTlczV72Q&t=349s). Excel also let's you use cell references and formulas to define dynamic values but I am sure we all know how ugly those formulas get with complicated calculation engineers carry out! You can also choose to store your data as a `.parquet`, `.pickle` or `.hdf` file all of which solve some of the data integrity issues however, these file types either easily get corrupted moving from one machine to another or require that you still read the entire file into memory to make minor edits or pull specific rows. There are spin-offs of the `pandas` library e.g. `dask` which eliminate the need to load entire datasets into memory to execute queries however they solve only a few of these problems at best.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core, any representation of data can be though of as being a database. Thus choosing to store data in a `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, or `.json`. e.t.c. format all have the same outcome: creation of a database. However, depending on how we plan to interface with the data, we might choose to one format over the other. A [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) is a database based on the [relational model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model) where data is stored in tuples and a group of tuples (think rows) form a relation (think table). Tables can then be linked by way of keys. With a relational database, you do not need to read entire tables into memory to make queries as the database management system handles the overhead behind the scenes. You also get to define data types when you declare the tables as well as any constraints that must be applied to the values entered into a column so that you ensure integrity in your data. by use of primary and foreign keys, you can maintain persistent links between tables. An important characteristic of relational database is that they possess [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties that ensure transactions on the database either succeed completely or fail completely even in edge cases like power outage or system crashes (atomicity), transactions adhere to the rules of the database (consistency), transactions are independent of simultaneously executed transactions (isolation) and successful transactions are persistent in memory even in a case of system failure (durability). All these reinforce the integrity of relational databases. Once the database structure is defined by way of a [schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema), you can carry out [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (create, read, update, delete) operations in a transaction. Almost all relational databases are written in [Structured Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) (SQL) that for the most part, reads like human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a number of engines that run on the relational model. Think of these engines as different 'operating systems' that allow you set up relations. Some of the popular ones are Oracle Database, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, MariaDB and SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The summary above is by no means an exhaustive introduction to relational databases as it is an entire course of its own in reality however, this tutorial will provide you with just enough information to start write your own SQL queries using the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/about.html) database engine. We choose SQLite here to introduce the relational database because unlike the other engines, SQLite does not require server maintenance as it resides in your local disk like any other flat file and can be copied, pasted and shared like any other file you are used to working with. It is the most widely deployed database engine found in almost all consumer electronics and yet it is free! In terms of limitations, a SQLite database can hold u to 281 TB of data and supports most frequently used statements in the more robust engines. It also comes preinstalled with Python so all we need to do is import the `sqlite3` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this tutorial will teach operations and concepts of relational databases using the SQLite engine."

    "The reason is that we use `building_id` as the `PRIMARY KEY` when defining our `TABLE`. `PRIMARY KEY` by definition must be unique as it is used as the unique identifier for any record. This highlights a design flaw in our current `TABLE` definition. It is possible that the same building name exists in two different sites. For example, every state has a Capitol Building. However, with the way we have designed our `TABLE`, we can only insert one record ever with `building_id` = `Capitol Building`! Yet, we still want to make sure that for the same `site_id`, there are no two buildings with the same `building_id`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The better way to define our `TABLE` is to use a truly unique `id` as the `PRIMARY KEY`. It is typical and safe approach is to use an `INTEGER` as unique ID for every table you create. There is a way to create a composite `PRIMARY KEY` where multiple two or more columns make up the key which has the advantage of automatically creating indexes for you that makes queries faster. However, sometimes it may be difficult to decide in the beginning what group of columns are always unique.\n",

    "The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint states that a column in a table is in fact referencing the `PRIMARY KEY` of another `TABLE`. The syntax used to define a `FOREIGN KEY` is `FOREIGN KEY (<column_name>) REFERENCES <referenced_table_name> (<referenced_table_primary_key_column_name>) ON DELETE <action> ON UPDATE <action>`. The `ON DELETE` `<action>` determines what happens if a record whose primary key is used in the referencing table as a foreign key get is deleted in the referenced table. Whereas, the `ON UPDATE` `<action>` determines what happens to the `FOREIGN KEY` in the referencing table if the `PRIMARY KEY` in the referenced table changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `<action>` can be set to any of the following:\n",
    "- `SET NULL`: When the primary key in the referenced table is deleted or updated, the foreign key in referencing table is set to `NULL`\n",
    "- `SET DEFAULT`: When the primary key in the referenced table is deleted or updated, the foreign key in referencing table is set to a predefined default value.\n",
    "- `RESTRICT`: This action prevents any delete or update to the primary key in referenced table unless all relations that reference it are removed.\n",
    "- `NO ACTION`: Same as `RESTRICT`\n",
    "- `CASCADE`: Propagates any change to the referenced table's primary key to all foreign key references.\n",
    "\n",
    "From experience, it is best to set the `ON DELETE` `<action>` to `NO ACTION` and the `ON UPDATE` `<action>` to `CASCADE`. Although, in practice, `PRIMARY KEY` does not change after it is set so the `ON UPDATE` `<action>` is seldom triggered. \n",
    "\n",
    "To normalize our existing `building_metadata` `TABLE`, we want to define new tables for columns that will otherwise have repeating text. These are the `building_id`, `site_id` and `primary_space_usage` columns. These tables will only store the unique names of buildings, sites and primary space usages. Then, their `PRIMARY KEY` will be entered into our redesigned `building_metadata` `TABLE` as `FOREIGN KEY` constraints. Let us go ahead to define these new tables:"

    "There are few things to note in the above query. First, we have used the `<column_name> AS <name>` syntax to reassign names to the columns of the returned view. This is called aliasing. This is important because sometimes as in our case, joined tables might have columns with the same names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we have given all four tables one-character aliases. This serves two purposes:\n",
    "1. It is convenient to reference the alias when qualifying a column instead of the full table name.\n",
    "2. It is used to resolve name conflicts for tables that have a common column name of `name` that is referenced in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we have joined using the `PRIMARY KEY`-`FOREIGN KEY` relationships using the `ON` keyword. However, you don't necessarily have to take this approach. You can apply joins on any two columns in two tables that have similar values. The only criteria for a `JOIN` to work is that two records are joined using columns that have the same value. You can also `JOIN` on multiple conditions. Our current schema does not afford us the ability to show such example but think of a scenario where you have one table that holds a time series of energy consumption for different commodities. The table has 3 columns: timestamp, commodity, consumption. Then there is another table that is a time series of dynamic pricing for each commodity with three columns as well: timestamp, commodity, price. If you wanted to write a query that enables you calculate the cost of any commodity at any timestamp, such query will resemble:\n",

    "    p.timestamp = c.timestamp \n",
    "    AND p.commodity = c.commodity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See how we have joined on both the timestamp and commodity columns? We also used an `INNER JOIN` so only commodities in table_1 that have price defined in table_2 will be returned. Also the returned view will include only records with timestamps that have price defined in table_2.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have returned all records in tables when we read from our database. However, more often than not, you only want to return a subset of the table. The `WHERE` keyword comes in handy as discussed in the next section."

The approach you choose is usually guided by writing style, level of brevity and cost of query in terms of time it takes to execute the query and return results. Initially, you typically start with something that just works! As your data grows in size, there might be a need to optimize your query to reduce its cost. Good design is to anticipate how your data will scale and design your initial queries to accommodate accordingly."
