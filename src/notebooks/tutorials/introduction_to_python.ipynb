This distinction between lists and tuples is very important when defining your data structures to hold variables as you build you Python code. Choosing one or the other can have rewarding or hair-pulling effects down the line. Let us take for example code that is meant to store the indoor dry-bulb temperature of a building from 3 years back. Data from 3 years ago is final and ideally, should not change as you work with it. In this case, a tuple seems better suited for its storage. However, you might want to do some data cleaning like replacing outliers with some average value. Using the same tuple variable, you will not be able to replace values unless you define a new tuple variable that stores the cleaned data. Depending on your system resources and data size, a new variable may or may not be ideal because time-series data, as you will see first-hand in this course, can vary easily take up a lot of memory. To save space, a list, where the element values can change might be better suited to store the initial raw data and the latter replacement preprocessed values.\n",

Operators allow you \"manipulate data, perform mathematical calculations, compare values, run boolean test, assign values to variables and more\" [[ref](https://realpython.com/python-operators-expressions)]. An operator is used on either one or more operands (think variables). An operator that acts on one operand is unary and whose those that act on two operands are binary.\n",

    "\n",
    "This section introduces the syntax for conditional statements on Python. Conditional statements help control the sequence of execution in a code block. The are also used to define rules that drive code execution. The keywords associated with conditional statements are `if`, `else`, `elif` and, `pass`. The general syntax for a conditional statement is:\n",

    "if <expression_1>:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    <statement_n>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements always start with the <if> clause and may optionally contain one or more <elif> clauses. The <else> clause is also optional however, it is good practice to always end an <if> clause with an <else> even though there is no statement for the <else> clause. It helps with code legibility and self-documentation. When an <else> clause has no statement, we use the <pass> keyword as a placeholder. As the name implies, it just allows the code execution to pass through without any action. The first statement whose expression has a true value will be executed while all other statements will not be executed. If none of the <if> nor <elif> expressions is true then the default statement defined in the  <else> clause is executed.\n",

What if we had no intentions of executing code that will throw errors but want to prepare for them just in case? This is where exception handling comes in handy.

Sometimes we may want out code to fail silently and continue executing but most times, we want to know when things don't go as planned and immediately as they happened. Other times, we want to also provide more meaningful information when our code fails but to do that, we need to anticipate its failure and catch it when it fails. We may also want to make sure a block of code always runs the end of our program regardless of if earlier code failed or not. This could be a post-run clean up operation that involves deleting files that will otherwise take up space.\n",
