        "[EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net) is a physics-based whole building energy performance simulation software. It is widely used in academia and academia by building energy professionals for design optimization, retrofit analyses, energy audits, and performance verification to mention a few.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to use EnergyPlus is to build an energy model from scratch. However, this approach requires a significant expertise and time investment as well as access to data that may not be readily available. The other route which we adopt in this class is to take advantage of stock energy models that have been developed and vetted by experts in the energy research field. To this end, we will make use of the [End-Use Load Profiles (EULP) for the U.S. Building Stock](https://www.nrel.gov/buildings/end-use-load-profiles.html) dataset that has about 900 thousand energy models representing the residential and commercial building stock in the United States. The dataset has had a few releases over the years however we will make use of the `resstock-amy2018-2021-release-1`. This [dataset](https://data.openei.org/s3_viewer?bucket=oedi-data-lake&prefix=nrel-pds-building-stock%2Fend-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock%2F2021%2Fresstock_tmy3_release_1%2F) is\n",

The `SQLite` database is easier to use when trying to manage results from many variables and thermal zones in a building. The `CSV` text file is a more familiar interface for most people. Let us start by using the `.csv` to retrieve and plot the outdoor and indoor dry-bulb temperature as well as the air system cooling and heating rates in any of the zones of the building. We will use the `SQLite` approach in a later tutorial."
