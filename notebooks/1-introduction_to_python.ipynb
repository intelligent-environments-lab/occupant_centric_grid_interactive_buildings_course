    "[Python](https://www.python.org) is one of many high-level programming languages that has grown in popularity for its easy implementation for prototyping new code and community-driven and open-source culture. It is relaxed in its syntax (which can be a curse sometime to be fair) and is sometimes referred to as executable pseudo-code since it reads like plain English. It has become very popular amongst non-traditional computer scientists for these reasons and is the more preferred language for data science and machine learning projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be impractical to to attempt to cover all the basics of the Python language as it can very easily turn into a class of itself. Instead, this tutorial will provides a brief and high-level introduction to Python but detailed enough for the purposes of a first-time coder in this class. In this tutorial, you will learn:\n",

For example, a variable that defines the dry-bulb temperature of a building is better defined as `indoor_dry_bulb_temperature`. One might be tempted to name it as just `dry_bulb_temperature` for brevity which might be confused with the weather's dry-bulb temperature. Also, `temperature` might be ambiguous since there are other relevant temperature variables within a building such wet-bulb temperature, operative temperature, e.t.c. `temp` might be obvious to someone reading your code that is familiar with its context but is also often used as a lazy name to define [temp]orary variables.\n",

    "The `TypeError` thrown above when we try to reassign the 0th element a new value tells us that the `tuple` type does not support such operation. This distinction between lists and tuples is very important when defining your data structures to hold variables as you build you Python code. Choosing one or the other can have rewarding or hair-pulling effects down the line. Let us take for example code that is meant to store the indoor dry-bulb temperature of a building from 3 years back. Data from 3 years ago is final and ideally, should not change as you work with it. In this case, a tuple seems better suited for its storage. However, you might want to do some data cleaning like replacing outliers with some average value. Using the same tuple variable, you will not be able to replace values unless you define a new tuple variable that stores the cleaned data. Depending on your system resources and data size, a new variable may or may not be ideal because time-series data, as you will see first-hand in this course, can vary easily take up a lot of memory. To save space, a list, where the element values can change might be better suited to store the initial raw data and the latter replacement preprocessed values.\n",

Operators allow you \"manipulate data, perform mathematical calculations, compare values, run boolean test, assign values to variables and more\" [[ref](https://realpython.com/python-operators-expressions)]. An operator is used on either one or more operands (think variables). An operator that acts on one operand is unary and whose those that act on two operands are binary.\n",

    "## Conditional statements\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces the syntax for conditional statements on Python. Conditional statements help control the sequence of execution in a code block. The are also used to define rules that drive code execution. The keywords associated with conditional statements are `if`, `else`, `elif` and, `pass`. The general syntax for a conditional statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if <expression_1>:\n",
    "    <statement_1>\n",
    "elif <expression_n-1>:\n",
    "    <statement_n-1>\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    <statement_n>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements always start with the <if> clause and may optionally contain one or more <elif> clauses. The <else> clause is also optional however, it is good practice to always end an <if> clause with an <else> even though there is no statement for the <else> clause. It helps with code legibility and self-documentation. When an <else> clause has no statement, we use the <pass> keyword as a placeholder. As the name implies, it just allows the code execution to pass through without any action. The first statement whose expression has a true value will be executed while all other statements will not be executed. If none of the <if> nor <elif> expressions is true then the default statement defined in the  <else> clause is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, notice the indentation when declaring the statements under their relevant expression. Python is indentation-sensitive!\n",
